# Scenarios

The exchange of equal pay (Inlenersbeloning) data involves communication between the staffing supplier, staffing customer, and intermediary parties, including their respective systems. The SETU inlenersbeloning standard defines two different scenarios for data exchange between those parties, as depicted in the picture below:

* **Scenario 1:** The staffing customer provides the equal pay data directly to the staffing customer without the involvement of CAO service providers.
* **Scenario 2:** CAO service providers supply the equal pay data directly to the staffing supplier.

This documentation page will elaborate on both scenarios, explaining what we mean by equal pay data and at what stage in the flexible staffing process it should be exchanged.

## Scenario 1

In this scenario, the staffing customer provides the equal pay data directly to the staffing supplier without involving CAO service providers. This means that only the staffing customer, the staffing supplier, and their back-office systems are involved. Typically, this scenario applies to large staffing customers who have a direct integration with the staffing supplier.

This exchange can take place at different stages:

* During the procurement process
* During the selection of a temporary worker for a specific assignment
* Before and during the placement of the temporary worker
* After the placement phase

As seen in the picture, the equal pay data can be sent based on a trigger/request from the staffing supplier. However, this request mechanism is currently outside the scope of the SETU standard and is not standardized. *Note*: This request process should not be confused with a data request of equal pay (de uitvraag). In this scenario, the staffing customer is responsible for delivering the complete set of equal pay data for one or more positions in their organisation.

## Scenario 2

In this scenario, CAO service providers directly supplies the equal pay data to the staffing supplier. Here, the CAO service provider, acting on behalf of the staffing supplier, initiates a request to the staffing customer to share their equal pay data with their system. As a result, the CAO service provider maintains the equal pay data within their system and translate the received request into the SETU equal pay format before exchanging it with the staffing supplier. The integration between CAO service providers and staffing customers is outside the scope of this document, see figure.

As with Scenario 1, this data exchange can take place at different stages of the employment process.

## What is meant with a correct equal pay data exchange?

Throughout the process, a correct equal pay data exchange means that the data is complete for **one or more job functions** or **complete for all job functions**. 

This means that the data about employment terms must be complete for one or more specified job functions or for all specified job functions within the organization. Partial delivery of equal pay data is not considered complete and is outside the scope of the SETU standard. However, partial incomplete equal pay data can be exchanged if agreed upon by the implementing parties. See the figure below.
