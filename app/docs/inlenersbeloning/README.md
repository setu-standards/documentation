:::caution DISCLAIMER
The SETU Standard for Inlenersbeloning v1.0 is currently under review. The public consultation period runs from 7 April till 2 May 2025. See this page for more information.

## Introduction
 
The "inlenersbeloning" aims to ensure that flexworkers earn and actually receive the same salary as the other employees of the client who perform the same tasks and are paid according to the client's collective labor agreement (CAO). To apply equal or equivalent pay, it is necessary to share the staffing customer (inlener) employment conditions with the staffing supplier (uitzender). This way, the staffing supplier can accurately translate the pay for each flexworker. The SETU has developed a standard to exchange these employment conditions between the staffing customer, the staffing supplier, and CAO parties.

## Scenario's

The exchange of equal pay (Inlenersbeloning) data involves communication between the staffing supplier, staffing customer, and CAO service providers, including their respective systems. The SETU inlenersbeloning standard defines two different scenarios for data exchange between these parties:

- **Scenario 1:** The staffing customer provides the equal pay data directly to the staffing supplier without the involvement of CAO service providers.
- **Scenario 2:** CAO service providers supply the equal pay data directly to the staffing supplier.


## Relation to HR Open standard


The new Inlenersbeloning SETU standards are based on a standardized SETU language in which concepts and relationships with associated terminology and definitions are specified. The SETU reuses the terminology and definitions of the latest version 4.3 of the international HR Open standard as much as possible for its SETU language. Where necessary, additional relationships have been established in the SETU language between existing HR Open concepts, or new concepts have been introduced. Definitions have also been improved and made more suitable for the inlenersbeloning context.

## Public consultation
For version 1.0 of the Inlenersbeloning standard, a public consultation will be conducted in April.

Interested parties will be invited to review the delivered standard and provide feedback. These responses will be considered by the SETU, discussed with the working group, and, where necessary, adjustments will be made to the draft version before the final publication.
