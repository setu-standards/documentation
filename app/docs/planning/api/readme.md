# API documentation

During the exchange of planning messages, multiple identifiers come into play. In this documentation page, we will go through the IDs and specify their functions. The following ID are taken into account:

- A new universally unique identifier (UUID) for modifying existing planning messages
- The included document id in the planning message (i.e., requestBody) itself
- The identifier to refer to a specific line in a particular planning message

This documentation page also contains a page with multiple examples about how the above mentioned identifiers can be used in the exchange of planning messages.
