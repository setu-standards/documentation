# Public consultation of SETU Standard for Planning & Scheduling v1.0 DRAFT

In the past period, the working group on Planning data has worked on the development of the SETU Standard for Planning & Scheduling. This standard makes it possible to exchange planning data between back-office software of staffing suppliers and planning systems, and between different planning systems. With this, the SETU fulfills an explicit wish of its community to develop a standard for the exchange of planning data.

We would like to invite you to take note of this and to provide us with comments on the SETU Standard for Planning & Scheduling v1.0 DRAFT. It contains the following message specifications:

- _Planning constraints:_ for the exchange of HR data and availability

- _Planning request:_ for exchanging a planning request

- _Planning assignment:_ for exchanging a completed planning

The specifications can be accessed via our [SETU standards portal](https://setu.semantic-treehouse.nl/#/Projects) and more information can be found about the public consultation and how to give your reactions: [How to review?](./review%20of%20planningstandards.md)

Responses from this public consultation will be considered by SETU, discussed with the working group and, where necessary, the draft versions will be adjusted before they are given the RELEASE status.

This consultation runs from 15 May 2023 to 15 June 2023.

If you have any questions, please send them to info@setu.nl.
