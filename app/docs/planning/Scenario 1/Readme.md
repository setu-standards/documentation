# Scenario 1:

## Planning entirly done in the Staffing Supplier's systems

In the first scenario, the staffing supplier is responsible for the planning. The staffing customer can make a request for a shift and indicate any preferences. The planning system of the staffing supplier will create a schedule and share it with the staffing customer. If there is a planning system on the staffing customer's side, this schedule will be taken over by the staffing customer. If changes to the schedule are necessary, an update to the request will be made. The staffing supplier processes this and shares a new schedule with the client. Please refer to the figure below:

A number of situations that also fall under scenario 1:

1. The HR information of the human resource come from the internal backoffice system of the staffing supplier to the planning system of the staffing supplier
2. The staffing supplier also does the planning for the staffing customer permanent employees. In this case, the HR information of the employee will come from the staffing customer instead of from the staffing supplier back office.
3. A representative of the staffing customer does the planning in the staffing supplier's systems.

To help users better understand how these endpoints in different systsems work together, the following pages include a series of sequence diagrams that illustrate the flow of REST calls in a particular scenario. These diagrams provide a visual representation of how the API can be used.
