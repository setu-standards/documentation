# Purchase to Pay v2.0

The SETU specified multiple message specifications to exchange purchase to pay information in the flexible staffing industry. The 'Purchase to pay' standards with a 2.0 version are the:
 - **SETU Standard for Ordering and Selection** is used for matching a human resource to an open position. It deals with electronically sending ordering and selection related information, including updates. This standard consists of two message specifications:
    - **Staffing Order** is used by a staffing customer to request and order (an) employee(s) for an open position.
    - **Human Resource** is used by the staffing supplier to match a human resource to an open position.
 - **SETU Standard for Assignment** is used by a staffing supplier for confirming the placement of a worker on a position at the staffing customer.
 - **SETU Standard for Reporting Time & Expenses** is used by the staffing customer to report time recording and expense related information to the staffing supplier.

The 2.0 versions of these message specification will be released at the end of 2024.

The standards can be found in [Semantic Treehouse](https://setu.semantic-treehouse.nl/specifications). There you can also find example messages and validation artifacts in both XML and JSON. The REST API specifications are specified in this documentation.

## Public consultation
The public consultation for all the message specifications will be performed around November 2024.

Interested parties are invited to review the delivered standard and provide review comments. Those responses are considered by the SETU, will be discussed with the working group and, where necessary, the draft version will be adjusted before final publication.
