# Timecard
The SETU Standard for Reporting Time and Expenses version 2.0 will be released at the end of 2024. The standard can be found in [Semantic Treehouse](https://setu.semantic-treehouse.nl/specifications). There you can also find example messages and validation artifacts in both XML and JSON. The REST API specifications are specified in this documentation.

## Scope
The SETU Standard for Reporting Time and Expenses is targeted at the process of reporting time & expenses in the staffing industry. It contains information models that describe the moments (when) and the content (what) of information exchange. It deals with capturing and electronically sending time recording information and expense related information, including corrections.

The standard supports a single transfer of information, from one sender of registration information to a receiver. The receiver may then proceed to process the information registered, e.g. for invoicing, payroll activities or for retransmission to another party. This implies that multi-party collaborations are out of scope.

This standard is intended for use only within the domain of staffing industry, and does not deal with, nor is intended to provide a general mechanism or design of reporting time & expenses, or a general purpose template for reporting time & expenses outside this domain.

## Supported processes
The processes supported with the message are specified under [Supported processes](Processes).

## Mapping to Timecard v1.4
To compare Timecard v2.0 with the previous version Timecard v1.4, you can view the [mapping at the treeview of Timecard v2.0](https://setu.semantic-treehouse.nl/message-model-tree/Message_39a2ff1b-43b3-40fc-930e-d85488bb57bb?panes=element_tree:Message_39a2ff1b-43b3-40fc-930e-d85488bb57bb:qvsi8y:primary,element_tree:Property_1478175108759638:u5oe3d). When the mapping to Timecard v1.4 is selected (by clicking 'Add Specification' and the select the mapping provided), for each element in v2.0 a mapping is shown to one or multiple elements in v1.4, and vice versa. This gives users accelerated insight into how certain information has been included in the new message and thus facilitates the adoption of the new version of the standard.
