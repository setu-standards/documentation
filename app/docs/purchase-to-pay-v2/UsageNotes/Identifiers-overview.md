The figure below provides an overview of how different identifiers relate to each other in the messages described in the 2.x versions of the Ordering & Selection, Assignment, Reporting Time & Expenses and Invoice standards.

The blocks with bold text illustrate identifiers of the message itself. Full orange blocks illustrate mandatory elements, whereas light orange blocks indicate optional elements.
