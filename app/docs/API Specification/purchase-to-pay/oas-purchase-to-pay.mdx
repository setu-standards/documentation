This OpenAPI specification defines a set of APIs for the exchange of the SETU Purchase to Pay messages. SETU has created several standardized messages to facilitate the processes involved in ordering and selecting human resource, and reporting time and expenses. This includes staffing orders, human resources, assignments, timecards, and invoices. The APIs are designed to be implemented primarily by backoffice systems of both the staffing customer and the staffing supplier. This page provides documentation about the OpenAPI specification.

The APIs are organized into tags for easy navigation and include descriptions for each set of APIs. The available tags include `Staffing Order`,' `Human Resource`, `Assignment`, `Timecard`, and `Invoice`, which include the API calls related to the different sets of SETU Purchase to Pay messages. Additionally, this API specification also provides tags for common processes that our encountered during the use of the Purchase to Pay messages. These processes include the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of various resources necessary for the purchase-to-pay process.

The request body of each API call in the OpenAPI specification is based on versions of the standardized message structure developed by SETU, ensuring that the request and response data adhere to a common and standardized format. This facilitates interoperability and ease of use across different software systems. The request body is available in both JSON and XML formats. More information about the SETU standards can be found [here](https://setu.semantic-treehouse.nl/#/Projects).
