This OpenAPI specification defines a set of APIs for the exchange of the SETU Inlenersbeloning. 

TO BE FILLED!

The request body of each API call in the OpenAPI specification is also available in Semantic Treehouse. The request body is based on the standardised message structure developed by SETU in Semantic Treehouse. This ensures that the request and response data of the API calls adhere to a common and standardised format, facilitating interoperability and ease of use across different software systems. More information about the SETU standards can be found [here](https://setu.semantic-treehouse.nl/#/Projects).
