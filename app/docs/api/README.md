# API Documentation

This section provides documentation to implement the SETU standards for `Purchase to Pay`, `Planning & Scheduling` and 'Inquiry Pay Equity'.

SETU provides Open API Specifications (OAS) for the message sets, which can be implemented by software systems for standardized message exchange.

In the case of `Purchase to Pay`, it is also possible to use the international Peppol network infrastructure to transport SETU messages. The Peppol-based exchange of SETU messages is described in the [Setu & Peppol](./Setu-Peppol.md) documentation.
