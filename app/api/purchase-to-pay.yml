They are combined with the resource identifiers as specified on the SETU documentation page. For example, `PUT /purchase-to-pay/timecard/c93efb20-1acd-447b-87e7-fadb108d8a0e/time-interval/2` can be used to update or get the information about a time-interval planningline with line ID `2` within a created timecard known by its resource identifier (UUID) as `'c93efb20-1acd-447b-87e7-fadb108d8a0e'`.
